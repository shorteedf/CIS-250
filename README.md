How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs can be interpreted by putting them into your own words and asking for confirmation from the user that you understood them correctly. Creating user stories can help take user needs and turn them into actionable units for development. User stories clearly define the requirements for the deliverable. They outline the action that the user takes, what the result should be, and gives a small amount of insight into why the requirement is being requested. Testers are able to create test cases based on the user stories and Developers are able to develop code to meet the functionality laid out. In this way user stories support implementing user needs into a program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs with the user's needs in mind. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work are scrums (when needed), product backlog management, sprint planning, and sprint review and retrospective. I think it's important for s development team to communicate on a regular basis to ensure they are on the same page. I will also want to employ an information radiator that can be updated in real-time. Product backlog management will be supportive in keeping the top priorities front and center and allow for effective sprint planning. Sprint planning will ensure that the team knows what work is expected to be completed and the sprint review/retrospective will allow the team to be thoughtful about the work that has been completed and help them to plan how to better complete work in the future.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development it helps to communicate openly and often with the rest of the team. One should take ownership of one's mistakes and lend a helping hand in any way possible to support other members of the team. Seeking clarity when needed is another attribute of a good team member.
